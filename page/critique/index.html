      		<h2>Singularity: The robots are coming to steal our jobs</h2>
      		<div class='completed'>By Jane Wakefield</div>
      		<p>
      		Artificial intelligence agents are already involved in every aspect of our lives - they keep our inboxes free of spam, they help us make our web transactions, they fly our planes and if Google gets its way will also soon drive our cars for us.
      		</p>
      		<p>
      		And each day the algorithms that power away, making decisions behind the scenes, are getting smarter.
      		</p>
      		<p>
      		Mr Jacobstein predicts that artificial intelligence will overtake human intelligence in the mid-2020s, begging the question - what will a society dominated by machine intelligence look like and what exactly will be our role in it?

      		<h2>Nine jobs that humans may lose to robots</h2>
      		<div class='completed'>By Judith Aquino</div>
      		<p>
      		Are humans becoming obsolete in the workforce? All signs point to "yes."
					</p>
					<p>
      		As IBM's Watson proved on Jeopardy, robots are becoming smarter than people. They also make fewer mistakes and they don't get bored.
					</p>
					<p>
      		By 2013 there will be 1.2 million industrial robots working worldwide — that's one robot for every 5,000 people, according to Marshall Brain, founder of How Stuff Works and author of Robotic Nation.
      		</p>
      		<p>
      		Robots are currently analyzing documents, filling prescriptions, and handling other tasks that were once exclusively done by humans.

      		<h2>My Response</h2>
      		<p>
      			Robots are designed for assisting human and creating the more efficient working and living environment. The concern of the potential threat from implementing robot to our daily life has created an unnecessary panic to our society. We must inspect this concern in two perspectives. Will Artificial Intelligence replace the human’s role in making decision? Will robot take away the job opportunity from us?
      		</p>
      		<p>
      			Artificial Intelligence still cannot replace human in role of making decisions due to the current technology limitation. This concern of human being replaced by robot is possible, but we should not focus on complaining or panicking. Instead, we should redefine our role in this society. If you take a look back to 100 years ago, automobile and various non-intelligent machines were taking over our jobs as well. The fact is that throughout the entire human history, advanced tools are always converting our living style and the structure of our society. Now, if you consider robot as another advanced tool which has no difference between the inventions of cars, you can understand why it is just a nature evolution to the society.
      		</p>
			<p>
				Our true question is to consider how we can accomplish something better with the assist from those robots. Just as the car replacing coachman, robot may replace some of the current job position. Yet, the invention of automobiles has benefited us way too much.
			</p>
			<p>
				In these two articles, they both mentioned about the job that can now be done by robot either partially or completely. This information is not to tell people in those professional fields to against with it. Those whose job has been taken away from robot should allow themselves to redefine their abilities and develops new unique skills. In this process, our society will enter a new era where human has been doing the same since the ancient time. Now, it is time that all of us should prepare ourselves for the transition.
